# GoLang Adventures

As much as I love ZendFramework 2, I'm getting a bit tired of PHP in general. In the ongoing pursuit to continually up my game I've decided to start learning GoLang for my backend web endeavours.

This repo hosts a collection random applications that I've built in order to familiarise myself with the Go language and related libraries.


###Reading List

- <strike>`How to Write Go Code`</strike>
- `A Tour of Go`
- `The Go Programming Language Specification`
- `Effective Go`


###Other Objectives

- Find an IDE
- Explore the Testing, Benchmarking and Example framework that comes with Go
- Find a web framework
