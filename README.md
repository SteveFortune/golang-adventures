# GoLang Adventures

As much as I love ZendFramework 2, I'm getting a bit tired of PHP in general. In the ongoing pursuit to continually up my game I've decided to start learning GoLang for my backend web endeavours.

This repo hosts a collection random snippets of go code that I've written in order to familiarise myself with the language syntax and APIs.


###Reading List

- <strike>`How to Write Go Code`</strike>
- <strike>`A Tour of Go`</strike>
- <strike>`The Go Programming Language Specification`</strike>
	- Had to read up on Backus Naur Form.
	- Will probably need to reread this at some point.
- <strike>`Effective Go`</strike>
- Also watched a few Google.io talks on Golang patterns

###Other Objectives

- <strike>Find an IDE</strike>: Atom + Go command line tools
- <strike>Explore the Testing, Benchmarking and Example framework that comes with Go</strike>
- <strike>Find a web framework</strike>: Just use the net package. Possibly Gorrilla's mux package for routing
