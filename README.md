# GoLang Adventures

As much as I love ZendFramework 2, I'm getting a bit tired of PHP in general. In the ongoing pursuit to continually up my game I've decided to start learning GoLang for my backend web endeavours.

This repo hosts a collection random snippets of go code that I've written in order to familiarise myself with the language syntax and APIs.
